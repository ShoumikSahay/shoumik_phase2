# Module-Reverse Engineering
## Challenge 1-GDB Baby 1
## What I did
```
$ file debugger0_a
$ gdb debugger0_a
(gdb) info functions
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) disassemble main
(gdb) print 0x86342
this is the value that EAX contains-549698.
picoCTF{549698} is the flag
```
## Flag
picoCTF{549698}
## What I learned
I learned how to use basic GDB commands to inspect a binary and extract a flag. I ran file to identify the executable, used gdb and info functions to find useful symbols, switched to Intel disassembly syntax, and disassembled main to follow the programâ€™s logic. By printing the value in the register (EAX) I could see the numeric result and convert it into the picoCTF flag format.
