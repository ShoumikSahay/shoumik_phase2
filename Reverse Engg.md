# Module-Reverse Engineering
## Challenge 1-GDB Baby 1
## What I did
```
$ file debugger0_a
$ gdb debugger0_a
(gdb) info functions
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) disassemble main
(gdb) print 0x86342
this is the value that EAX contains-549698.
picoCTF{549698} is the flag
```
## Flag
picoCTF{549698}
## What I learned
I learned how to use basic GDB commands to inspect a binary and extract a flag. I ran file to identify the executable, used gdb and info functions to find useful symbols, switched to Intel disassembly syntax, and disassembled main to follow the programâ€™s logic. By printing the value in the register (EAX) I could see the numeric result and convert it into the picoCTF flag format.
## Challenge 3-Vault door 3
## What I did
```
The program reads an input of the form picoCTF{<password>} and passes the substring <password> (length 32 expected) to checkPassword(). That method builds a 32-char buffer by reading characters from the input password with four different index patterns, then compares new String(buffer) with the fixed target: jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340
The solution is to invert the buffer construction to recover the original password that, after rearrangement, equals the target.
// extracts user input between picoCTF{ and }
String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(), userInput.length()-1);

public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    if (password.length() != 32) {
        return false;
    }
    char[] buffer = new char[32];
    int i;
    for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
    }
    for (; i<16; i++) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
    }
    for (; i<32; i+=2) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
    }
    for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
        buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
    }
    return new String(buffer).equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340");
}
RECONSTRUCTION SCRIPT-
target = list("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18gb41_u_4_mfr340")
password = ['?'] * 32

# Loop A inverse: i = 0..7
for i in range(0, 8):
    password[i] = target[i]

# Loop B inverse: i = 8..15 -> password[23 - i] = target[i]
for i in range(8, 16):
    password[23 - i] = target[i]

# Loop C inverse: i = 16,18,...,30 -> password[46 - i] = target[i]
for i in range(16, 32, 2):
    password[46 - i] = target[i]

# Loop D inverse: i = 31,29,...,17 -> password[i] = target[i]
for i in range(31, 16, -2):
    password[i] = target[i]

recovered = "".join(password)
print(recovered)

OUTPUT-jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_1fb380

```
## Flag
picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_1fb380}

## What I learned
I learned how to carefully read and reverse-engineer Java code by understanding how loops and index manipulation work. I realized that even though the program looked complicated at first, breaking it down into small logical steps made it much easier to follow. I also learned how to invert operations to reconstruct the original input and how to verify my results using a simple Python script.
